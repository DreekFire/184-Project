<h1 align="middle">Final Project Proposal: Strandbeest Simulation</h1>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  We created a simulation of a <a href="https://www.strandbeest.com/">strandbeest</a> walking along a beach. We will primarily focus on the simulation of the physical joints of the strandbeest and the visual rendering of the sand. If we have extra time, we may also incorporate physically realistic procedural generation of the sand and have it move under then strandbeest.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Overview</h2>
<h3>Joint Simulation</h3>
<p>Many mechanical systems (including the strandbeest) contain prismatic and revolute joints, which describe constraints between the poses of two objects. In reality, these are usually enforced by collisions between pieces of solid matter, which act like extremely stiff springs that push the objects back into place as they deform. Many video games (Space Engineers, Stormworks, Terratech, Kerbal Space Program) take this approach of modeling these constraints as springs, which allows physical simulation of how these joints deform under load, but sometimes results in unstable simulations which destroy player creations (Clang, Kraken, etc.).</p>

<p>
  We would like to simulate these joints in a way that inherently respects the constraints using one of several different techniques that have been proposed to simulate systems with holonomic constraints (which joint constraints are). We hope this will result in much more stable simulations, effectively eliminating the physics monsters which plague many building games. Additionally, when external forces are negligible compared to the joint's rigidity, this approach would be better, as it automatically renders the joints perfectly rigid, while the old approach would require extremely stiff springs and thus a very small time step. However, when external forces are not negligible compared to the joint's rigidity, this approach would not allow the joint to deform in directions apart from its axis of motion, so the spring-based approach would be more accurate.
</p>

<h3>Sand Rendering</h3>
<p>
  To give our strandbeest an environment to walk through, we will implement a sand shader to recreate its natural environment (water not included).
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Metrics</h2>
<p>
  For our joint simulation, we will simulate the strandbeest using both the holonomic constraint approach and the spring-based approach with increasing time steps. We will measure how much each constraint is violated, i.e. the distance between each moving object and its intended axis of motion.

  For our sand simulation, we will inspect the sand visually and remark on how it's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Analysis</h2>
<p>
  We will answer whether using a simulation method which inherently respects the joint constraints is practical for creating a stable simulation at real-time speeds for use in video games and find some parameters for creating an aesthetically pleasing sand simulation.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Deliverables</h2>
<p>
  We will deliver a simulator which enforces holonomic constraints during the simulation step. We will use it to simulate a strandbeest walking through a sandy environment, which we will render using a custom sand shader.
